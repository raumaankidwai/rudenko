# Rudenko
Rudenko's Disk: Representation, Notation, Random-State Scrambling

# Representation
There are 3 branches: Left, Middle, and Right. Each one has its own array with colors from 0 (red) to 6 (pink). TODO: Make variable.

# Notation
L = Left branch
M = Middle branch
R = Right branch

XY = Move the top circle on X to Y

# Random-State Scrambling
1) Implement a solver (mostly trivial)
2) Generate solveable random states
